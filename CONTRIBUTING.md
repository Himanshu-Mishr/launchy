# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

## Before you create a PRâ€¦
Please [create an issue](https://github.com/svinkle/launchy/issues) first to discuss your idea with the maintainer(s). After we've chatted things through, go ahead with your work and send over a PR.

## Branches
Please create a feature branch with your changes in the format: `[fix/feature/etc]/[description]` -- this help to gage what the branch is for later on.

## Local setup

1. Fork and clone the project
2. Change dicrecories: `cd launchy`
3. Install deps: `npm install`
4. Launch the brochure site: `npm start`

From here anything you change, including files in the `/brochure` or `/src` directories will automatically refresh the browser.
