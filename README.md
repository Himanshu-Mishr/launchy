## Usage

_Launchy_ is very easy to install and use:

### HTML
Wherever you want to have a _Launchy_ control + window appear in your HTML content, simply **wrap** your content with a `<div>` and add the `data-launchy` attribute.

Example:

```html
<div data-launchy data-launchy-text="Launch window!" data-launchy-title="My modal window">
    <p>This content will appear in the modal window.</p>
</div>
```

- **Required**: `data-launchy` -- Attribute is required but the value can be anything
- **Required**: `data-launchy-text` -- This is the text that will be output to the launcher control
- Optional: `data-launcy-title` -- The text which appears in the heading of the modal window, recommended for greater a11y context üëç

### JavaScript
For any site, grab the `/dist/launchy.js` file and include it at the bottom of your HTML page/template:

```html
<script src="js/launchy.js"></script>
```

_Launchy_ will run automatically and generate all the modal windows for you!

### `npm` Package
